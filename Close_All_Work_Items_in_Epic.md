# Work Items Closure Investigation Transcript

## Session Date
June 3, 2025

## Initial Request
**User:** Close all the work items under Epic with Epic Name 'Q4 232 QTC: Performance Automation' that has been created for more than 10 days and priority level equals to 4.

## Investigation Process

### Step 1: Epic Search
**Assistant:** I need to find the Epic with the specified name first. Let me search for it using the existing tools.

**Action:** Used fuzzy search to find the Epic
- Initial search with full name had issues due to special characters
- Simplified search term to "Performance Automation"
- Found multiple results including Epics

### Step 2: Epic Identification
**Action:** Used EpicService.getEpicByName() to find the exact Epic

**Result:**
```json
{
  "Id": "a3QB00000005lbQMAQ",
  "Name": "Q4 232 QTC: Performance Automation",
  "Description__c": "Automation of API and limits performance assessment",
  "Health__c": "Completed",
  "Planned_Release__c": null,
  "Team__c": "a00B0000006iJdVIAU",
  "Team__r": {
    "Name": "Rev Q4 - Gladiators"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Work Items Retrieval
**Action:** Retrieved all work items under the Epic using WorkService.getWorkForEpics()

### Step 4: Criteria Filtering
**Action:** Filtered work items based on the specified criteria:
- Priority level equals 4
- Created more than 10 days ago

**SOQL Query Used:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Priority__c, CreatedDate, Status__c 
FROM ADM_Work__c 
WHERE Epic__c = 'a3QB00000005lbQMAQ'
```

**Detailed Analysis Results:**
- **W-8579220**: Priority N/A, Created 1631 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8596884**: Priority N/A, Created 1628 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8623439**: Priority N/A, Created 1610 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8659188**: Priority N/A, Created 1607 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8668293**: Priority N/A, Created 1606 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8668356**: Priority N/A, Created 1606 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8672761**: Priority N/A, Created 1604 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-8683365**: Priority N/A, Created 1603 days ago, Status: Closed
- **W-18698184**: Priority P4, Created 0 days ago, Status: Closed

### Step 5: Priority Format Verification
**Action:** Tested both priority formats "4" and "P4" to ensure complete coverage

**Query 1 (Priority = "4"):**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Priority__c, CreatedDate, Status__c 
FROM ADM_Work__c 
WHERE Epic__c = 'a3QB00000005lbQMAQ' 
AND Priority__c = '4' 
AND CreatedDate < 2025-05-24T18:36:25.178Z
```
**Result:** No records found

**Query 2 (Priority = "P4"):**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Priority__c, CreatedDate, Status__c 
FROM ADM_Work__c 
WHERE Epic__c = 'a3QB00000005lbQMAQ' 
AND Priority__c = 'P4' 
AND CreatedDate < 2025-05-24T18:36:16.503Z
```
**Result:** No records found

## Final Conclusion

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Epic Successfully Located:** 'Q4 232 QTC: Performance Automation' (ID: a3QB00000005lbQMAQ)
2. **Total Work Items Found:** 9 items under the Epic
3. **Priority Analysis:** 
   - 8 items have Priority = N/A (null)
   - 1 item has Priority = P4 (W-18698184)
4. **Creation Date Analysis:**
   - Most items were created 1600+ days ago
   - Only 1 item was created recently (0 days ago)
5. **Status Analysis:** All 9 work items are already in "Closed" status

### Result:
**NO ACTION REQUIRED** - No work items matched the specified criteria:
- No work items have priority level 4 AND were created more than 10 days ago
- The only item with Priority P4 was created today (0 days ago)
- All items are already closed

### Technical Notes:
- Priority field accepts string values ("P4", not "4")
- Date filtering used SOQL with proper ISO date format
- Used existing MCP tools without creating new functionality
- Comprehensive verification performed with multiple query approaches

## Tools and Methods Used:
1. `SearchService.fuzzySearch()` - For initial Epic discovery
2. `EpicService.getEpicByName()` - For precise Epic identification
3. `WorkService.getWorkForEpics()` - For work items retrieval
4. Custom SOQL queries via `querySfdx()` - For criteria filtering
5. Manual analysis and verification - For comprehensive coverage

## Resolution:
The request has been completed. Investigation showed that no work items under the specified Epic meet the criteria for closure (priority level 4 AND created more than 10 days ago). All work items in the Epic are already in "Closed" status.
