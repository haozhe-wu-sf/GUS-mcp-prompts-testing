# GUS Blocker Reminder Implementation - Complete Transcript

## Session Overview
**Date**: December 3, 2024  
**Objective**: Implement automatic blocker reminder comments for GUS work items without due dates  
**User Request**: "On GUS, automatically make a reminder comment to the person the work item 'Assigned TO' and the 'Scrum lead' of that assigned team, as the GUS post on a Blocker bug if no Due date is set."

## Initial Analysis and Discovery

### 1. User Request Analysis
The user requested a feature to automatically create reminder comments on GUS (Salesforce) work items that are:
- Blocker bugs (high priority)
- Missing due dates
- Should notify both the assignee and scrum lead

### 2. Codebase Exploration
**Assistant explored the MCP server structure:**
- Examined `mcp-server-gus/` directory structure
- Reviewed existing services and models
- Analyzed current commenting functionality in `CommentService.js`
- Investigated work item structure in `WorkItem.js` model
- Examined team member relationships in `TeamMember.js`

**Key Findings:**
- Existing `CommentService.createWorkComment()` for adding comments
- `WorkItem` model with `Priority__c` and `Due_Date__c` fields
- Priority values use format like "P1", "P2", "P4" 
- No explicit "blocker" field, but P1/P2 priorities likely indicate blockers
- Team structure exists but no explicit scrum lead field
- Need to identify scrum lead heuristically (highest allocation percentage)

### 3. Architecture Decision
**Decided to implement:**
- New `BlockerReminderService` following existing patterns
- New MCP tool `createBlockerReminders`
- Integration with existing `CommentService` and team models
- Support for configurable priority levels and team scoping

## Implementation Process

### 4. Created BlockerReminderService.js

**File:** `mcp-server-gus/src/services/BlockerReminderService.js`

**Key Methods Implemented:**
```javascript
// Main function
static async createBlockerReminders({ 
  teamIds = [], 
  includeCurrentUserTeams = true,
  blockerPriorities = ['P1', 'P2']
})

// Query builder for finding blocker bugs
static buildBlockerBugQuery(teamIds, blockerPriorities)

// Comment creation for individual work items
static async createReminderComment(workItem)

// Team lead detection using allocation percentage
static async findTeamLead(teamId)
```

**Core Logic:**
1. **Query Construction**: Find bugs with Type__c = 'Bug', null Due_Date__c, specified priorities
2. **Team Scoping**: Support both specific teams and current user's teams
3. **Comment Generation**: Create mentions for assignee and detected scrum lead
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
5. **Summary Generation**: Detailed reporting of all actions taken

**Comment Format Example:**
```
ðŸš¨ BLOCKER REMINDER: @AssigneeName @ScrumLeadName This P1 priority bug currently has no due date set. Please set a due date to ensure proper tracking and resolution planning.

Work Item: W-12345678
Subject: Authentication Issue
Priority: P1
Status: In Progress
Team: Platform Team
```

### 5. Updated MCP Server Configuration

**File:** `mcp-server-gus/mcp-server.js`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added Import**: `import { BlockerReminderService } from "./src/services/BlockerReminderService.js"`

2. **Registered New Tool**:
```javascript
server.tool(
  "createBlockerReminders",
  `Automatically find blocker bugs without due dates and create reminder comments mentioning the assignee and scrum lead.
   
   This tool identifies high-priority bugs (P1, P2 by default) that don't have a due date set and creates 
   automatic reminder comments on them. The comments will mention both the assigned person and the team's 
   scrum lead (identified as the team member with highest allocation percentage).
   
   IMPORTANT: This is an automated action that will create comments on multiple work items.`,
  { 
    teamIds: z.array(z.string()).default([]).describe("Array of Salesforce Team IDs to scope the search to specific teams (optional)"),
    includeCurrentUserTeams: z.boolean().default(true).describe("Whether to include bugs from the current user's teams"),
    blockerPriorities: z.array(z.string()).default(['P1', 'P2']).describe("Priority levels considered as blockers that need due dates")
  },
  createToolHandler(BlockerReminderService.createBlockerReminders, "Failed to create blocker reminders")
);
```

- Natural language interface through Cursor AI

### 11. Usage Examples

**Basic Usage (Check current user's teams):**
```javascript
createBlockerReminders({})
```

**Specific Teams Only:**
```javascript
createBlockerReminders({
  teamIds: ["a07xxxxxxxxxxxxx", "a07yyyyyyyyyyy"],
  includeCurrentUserTeams: false
})
```

**Custom Priority Levels:**
```javascript
createBlockerReminders({
  blockerPriorities: ["P1", "P2", "P3"]
})
```

**Through Cursor AI Natural Language:**
```
"Check for blocker bugs without due dates in my teams and create reminder comments"
```

### 12. Technical Architecture

**Service Layer:**
- `BlockerReminderService.js` - Main business logic
- Follows 1:1 service-entity separation principle
- Multi-step query pattern for complex relationships
- Proper input validation and error handling

**Query Strategy:**
```sql
SELECT [fields] FROM ADM_Work__c 
WHERE Type__c = 'Bug' 
  AND Due_Date__c = null
  AND Priority__c IN ('P1', 'P2')
  AND Status__c IN ('New', 'Waiting', 'In Progress', 'Triaged', 'Ready for Review')
  AND [team filters]
ORDER BY Priority__c ASC, CreatedDate ASC
```

**Scrum Lead Detection:**
- Query team members via `ADM_Scrum_Team_Member__c`
- Sort by `Allocation__c` percentage (descending)
- Select member with highest allocation as potential lead
- Fallback handling for teams with no members

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### 16. Potential Enhancements

**Future Improvements Could Include:**
1. **Explicit Scrum Lead Field**: Add dedicated scrum lead field to team model
2. **Scheduling Integration**: Add cron job or scheduling capabilities
3. **Notification Templates**: Customizable comment templates
4. **Escalation Logic**: Progressive reminder system
5. **Metrics Dashboard**: Tracking of blocker resolution times
6. **Integration Webhooks**: Real-time notifications to external systems

**Deployment Considerations:**
1. **Testing**: Test with actual GUS data before production use
2. **Permissions**: Verify comment creation permissions for service account
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider API limits for bulk comment creation
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring for production use

This implementation provides a solid foundation for automated blocker management in GUS while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and organizational needs.
